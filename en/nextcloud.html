            <p class="text ntext">To synchronize and back up my files, I have set up a Nextcloud server. This way, I keep control of my data and privacy.</p>
            <p class="text ntext">My goal is to <a href="https://richou-667-netw.tplinkdns.com">make it accessible on the internet</a>, so it is necessary to secure it. That's why I opted for the preconfigured version on the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/nextcloud">Snapcraft store</a>, which is secure by default (provided you use a strong password).</p>
            <p class="text ntext">I have not opened port 22 (secure remote access) to prevent remote brute force attacks. Instead, I have activated the OpenVPN server function on my TpLink router, allowing me to have secure full access remotely.</p>
            <p class="text ntext">Currently, I'm not sure if I will keep this server indefinitely, but it is currently very useful. If I use it less, I will repurpose it into a Home Assistant server (more powerful than the current server for voice command).</p>
            <p class="text ntext">To check if the server is secure, you can use the tool provided by Nextcloud. I have done that, and you can see the result below (you can do it too if you want to verify).</p>
